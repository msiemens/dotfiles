## What's inside?

You'll find config files for:

- intelligent bash history
- beautiful bash prompt
- git status in bash prompt
- useful screenrc
- python shell improvements
- ssh-agent

## Installer

I've written a simple installer for all the files and dependencies. But don't
use it now, because it's very buggy.
